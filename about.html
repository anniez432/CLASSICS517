            <h1>About this project:</h1>
            <p>
                <br>
                Classics 517, Ancient Religions of the Mediterranean, covers diverse topics in three broad areas: 
                Greek religion, Roman religion, and the Rise of Christianity. The assigned readings, assignments, 
                and exams throughout the semester are text-based, sourced from texts like academic studies and historical 
                poems. This project aims to develop an interactive blog-style website that will bridge the gap between 
                these text-based sources and supplementary academic visual information, such as illustrations, maps, or 
                statues, that is available online, in hopes of creating lasting support in this course for myself and future students. 
                The course consists of pre-lecture readings and writing assignments to gain knowledge about the lecture
                topics. By providing a visual parallel for these writing assignments and including analyses of how they are 
                related, I will gain a more concrete and richer understanding of course topics. By complimenting the 
                pre-existing materials and assignments, this project will be relevant to the course while introducing an 
                intensive learning experience.
