                    <p>“A big animal sacrifice sponsored by the state was therefore a 
                        festive occasion for the whole citizen community, with a procession 
                        before the sacrifice and a banquet afterwards for as many as could 
                        be fed. In prosperous Classical Athens, a man could expect to take part 
                        in a sacrifice about once a week. Private individuals might perform a 
                        sacrifice in celebration of some event or a successful hunt and invite 
                        their friends to a meal at which the meat was eaten, or a rich man might 
                        feast the members of his village as a benefaction. The gods usually 
                        received, as smoke and smell, the bones and other inedible bits, but the 
                        rest was consumed by humans, with a special cut set aside for the 
                        presiding priest.”

                        <br><br>
                        This passage’s description of how community and religion are intertwined 
                        in Greek culture could help answer part of the question of what constitutes 
                        Greek religion. We can gather that their religion’s practice of honoring 
                        and respecting their gods was present in their daily lives, signaling 
                        its direct and heavy influence. Being able to expect and then participate 
                        in weekly sacrifices with their entire city must have been important in each 
                        individual’s life. It also may have strengthened their sense of community, 
                        as they had this common religion and practices.
                        <br>
                        This passage also touches on Greek religion’s relationship with politics 
                        and economic statuses. It specifies that the big animal sacrifices that 
                        men in Classical Athens could participate in each week were sponsored 
                        by the state, an indicator that Greek religion was also intertwined with 
                        their politics. It also provides insight into how wealthy citizens could 
                        host their own sacrifices for the gods as they had the means, and even to 
                        potentially feed other community members.
                        <br>
                        The last sentence of this passage describing how the sacrifice is split 
                        between the gods, citizens, and the presiding priest emphasizes the respect 
                        Greeks have for religious figures and the hierarchy dictated by their 
                        religious practices. The gods, with the most power, are at the top, 
                        followed by the priest, and then the citizens. Their adherence to this 
                        hierarchy is a demonstration of their respect for the traditions.

                            This marble relief shows an animal sacrifice with four youth, 
                            likely boys, leading the cow during a procession of the Panathenaic 
                            festival. This image reinforces the idea from the passage that sacrifices 
                            were significant in ancient Greece for most, if not all citizens. The 
                            setting of the large festival and inclusion of members of the Athenian 
                            community highlights how this tradition was public and deeply ingrained 
                            within their society.
                            <br>
                            The passage mentions how frequent such festivities and sacrifices 
                            were in Classical Athens. This marble block reflects how these sacrifices 
                            brought people together to partake in religious traditions together, as 
                            well as the state-sponsored aspect of such festivals. The state-sponsored 
                            aspect of the Panathenaic festival is important to note as it explains how 
                            interconnected the political, religious, and societal spheres were. 
                            <br>
                            Together, the passage and the visual evidence show us that animal 
                            sacrifice was much more than just a ritual - it was a way for citizens 
                            to actively participate in both their civic and religious duties, strengthening 
                            both their religious beliefs and their connections with each other. People were 
                            surrounded by collective religious worship, making Greek religion both essential 
                            to and reliant on ancient Greek culture and society.

                    <p>“Stories about this family were told or represented in many different contexts. 
                        Children heard the myths at the knees of their mothers or nurses. Aristocratic 
                        men in archaic and classical Greece attending their symposia (formalised 
                        drinking parties) liked to tell myths. As we shall see later, myths were 
                        omnipresent in sanctuaries and festivals, both iconographically and verbally. 
                        They were also very visible in other public places: in the Athenian agora, for 
                        example, one sota (portico) gained its name ‘Painted’ because it served to display 
                        four fifth-century BC paintings by the outstanding artists of the day on mythical 
                        and historical topics (cf. below, p.22). The thousands of extant vases of the 
                        seventh to fourth centuries BC depict scenes of the gods and heroes. Some of them 
                        are influenced by now lost works in other media (paintings, tapestries, metalwork), 
                        others are fresh creations of the individual pot painter. The context of these pots 
                        is important. They are the product of artists, including non-Greek slaves, working 
                        in different states and should ideally not all be lumped together as ‘Greek’. Many 
                        of the pots, though preserved for us because they were exported to Etruria in Italy 
                        where they were buried in chamber tombs, were designed in the first instance for 
                        the aristocratic Greek sumposion. Myth-telling and the pottery for the wine-drinking 
                        were complementary.”

                        <br><br>

                        This passage describes various parts of Greek religion relating to the spread of the 
                        myths of the Greek gods and its presence in Greek art and culture. Both of these 
                        aspects of Greek religion are crucial to determining the constitution of Greek Religion 
                        in Ancient Greece. The first part of the passage focuses on how the Greek myths were 
                        spread throughout their history, and the second, large part details how the myths were 
                        present in various art forms and played roles in community events.
                        <br>
                        The author’s description of how myths were told verbally through families and parties, 
                        and visually through public areas and events helps us understand how the myths of the 
                        Greek Panhellenic were likely known by most Greeks, regardless of economic status. This 
                        highlights the connection their religion provided, as citizens of all economic statuses 
                        heard (variations of) the same myths. They weren’t just limited to those with the most 
                        wealth and power, as even the poorer working class heard and told those stories.
                        <br>
                        Similarly, the depiction of mythical topics on art, specifically pots, help us understand 
                        the impact religion had on creative and working lives. The fact that pots with those 
                        mythical depictions were chosen to be created by artists, some of whom weren’t Greek, 
                        and were sent to and buried in Italy suggests its widespread influence. This is likely an 
                        important part of the Greek Religion as it clearly brought people together past city-state 
                        and geographical boundaries with common stories and experiences.

                            This image of the Painted Portico, known as Stoa Poikile, provides additional depth 
                            and understanding of the role myths and art played in Greek religion. The passage 
                            touches on how paintings of mythical and historical topics were displayed in the public 
                            portico, but the image highlights just how important this location was. According to Donald 
                            Robertson, “it’s very public and situated among the shops on the edge of the Athenian agora, 
                            precisely where Socrates used to mingle with craftsmen discussing philosophy.” The display of 
                            myths in such a central location where people would gather and discuss intellectual and cultural 
                            topics shows that religion was fully integrated into everyday life in ancient Greece. 
                            <br>
                            This is important to note when understanding what constitutes Greek religion - it was more than 
                            just personal beliefs and rituals. Having this visual evidence of the Stoa helps us better 
                            understand how central religion was in the civic community. Even though it is just ruins now, 
                            it’s still in the center of the city, hopefully an enduring reminder that Greek myths and religion 
                            weren’t just stories that were told and personal beliefs - they shaped beliefs, identities, and values.
