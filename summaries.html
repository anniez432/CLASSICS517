                    <p>“A big animal sacrifice sponsored by the state was therefore a 
                        festive occasion for the whole citizen community, with a procession 
                        before the sacrifice and a banquet afterwards for as many as could 
                        be fed. In prosperous Classical Athens, a man could expect to take part 
                        in a sacrifice about once a week. Private individuals might perform a 
                        sacrifice in celebration of some event or a successful hunt and invite 
                        their friends to a meal at which the meat was eaten, or a rich man might 
                        feast the members of his village as a benefaction. The gods usually 
                        received, as smoke and smell, the bones and other inedible bits, but the 
                        rest was consumed by humans, with a special cut set aside for the 
                        presiding priest.”

                        <br><br>
                        This passage’s description of how community and religion are intertwined 
                        in Greek culture could help answer part of the question of what constitutes 
                        Greek religion. We can gather that their religion’s practice of honoring 
                        and respecting their gods was present in their daily lives, signaling 
                        its direct and heavy influence. Being able to expect and then participate 
                        in weekly sacrifices with their entire city must have been important in each 
                        individual’s life. It also may have strengthened their sense of community, 
                        as they had this common religion and practices.
                        <br>
                        This passage also touches on Greek religion’s relationship with politics 
                        and economic statuses. It specifies that the big animal sacrifices that 
                        men in Classical Athens could participate in each week were sponsored 
                        by the state, an indicator that Greek religion was also intertwined with 
                        their politics. It also provides insight into how wealthy citizens could 
                        host their own sacrifices for the gods as they had the means, and even to 
                        potentially feed other community members.
                        <br>
                        The last sentence of this passage describing how the sacrifice is split 
                        between the gods, citizens, and the presiding priest emphasizes the respect 
                        Greeks have for religious figures and the hierarchy dictated by their 
                        religious practices. The gods, with the most power, are at the top, 
                        followed by the priest, and then the citizens. Their adherence to this 
                        hierarchy is a demonstration of their respect for the traditions.

                            This marble relief shows an animal sacrifice with four youth, 
                            likely boys, leading the cow during a procession of the Panathenaic 
                            festival. This image reinforces the idea from the passage that sacrifices 
                            were significant in ancient Greece for most, if not all citizens. The 
                            setting of the large festival and inclusion of members of the Athenian 
                            community highlights how this tradition was public and deeply ingrained 
                            within their society.
                            <br>
                            The passage mentions how frequent such festivities and sacrifices 
                            were in Classical Athens. This marble block reflects how these sacrifices 
                            brought people together to partake in religious traditions together, as 
                            well as the state-sponsored aspect of such festivals. The state-sponsored 
                            aspect of the Panathenaic festival is important to note as it explains how 
                            interconnected the political, religious, and societal spheres were. 
                            <br>
                            Together, the passage and the visual evidence show us that animal 
                            sacrifice was much more than just a ritual - it was a way for citizens 
                            to actively participate in both their civic and religious duties, strengthening 
                            both their religious beliefs and their connections with each other. People were 
                            surrounded by collective religious worship, making Greek religion both essential 
                            to and reliant on ancient Greek culture and society.

                    <p>“Stories about this family were told or represented in many different contexts. 
                        Children heard the myths at the knees of their mothers or nurses. Aristocratic 
                        men in archaic and classical Greece attending their symposia (formalised 
                        drinking parties) liked to tell myths. As we shall see later, myths were 
                        omnipresent in sanctuaries and festivals, both iconographically and verbally. 
                        They were also very visible in other public places: in the Athenian agora, for 
                        example, one sota (portico) gained its name ‘Painted’ because it served to display 
                        four fifth-century BC paintings by the outstanding artists of the day on mythical 
                        and historical topics (cf. below, p.22). The thousands of extant vases of the 
                        seventh to fourth centuries BC depict scenes of the gods and heroes. Some of them 
                        are influenced by now lost works in other media (paintings, tapestries, metalwork), 
                        others are fresh creations of the individual pot painter. The context of these pots 
                        is important. They are the product of artists, including non-Greek slaves, working 
                        in different states and should ideally not all be lumped together as ‘Greek’. Many 
                        of the pots, though preserved for us because they were exported to Etruria in Italy 
                        where they were buried in chamber tombs, were designed in the first instance for 
                        the aristocratic Greek sumposion. Myth-telling and the pottery for the wine-drinking 
                        were complementary.”

                        <br><br>

                        This passage describes various parts of Greek religion relating to the spread of the 
                        myths of the Greek gods and its presence in Greek art and culture. Both of these 
                        aspects of Greek religion are crucial to determining the constitution of Greek Religion 
                        in Ancient Greece. The first part of the passage focuses on how the Greek myths were 
                        spread throughout their history, and the second, large part details how the myths were 
                        present in various art forms and played roles in community events.
                        <br>
                        The author’s description of how myths were told verbally through families and parties, 
                        and visually through public areas and events helps us understand how the myths of the 
                        Greek Panhellenic were likely known by most Greeks, regardless of economic status. This 
                        highlights the connection their religion provided, as citizens of all economic statuses 
                        heard (variations of) the same myths. They weren’t just limited to those with the most 
                        wealth and power, as even the poorer working class heard and told those stories.
                        <br>
                        Similarly, the depiction of mythical topics on art, specifically pots, help us understand 
                        the impact religion had on creative and working lives. The fact that pots with those 
                        mythical depictions were chosen to be created by artists, some of whom weren’t Greek, 
                        and were sent to and buried in Italy suggests its widespread influence. This is likely an 
                        important part of the Greek Religion as it clearly brought people together past city-state 
                        and geographical boundaries with common stories and experiences.

                            This image of the Painted Portico, known as Stoa Poikile, provides additional depth 
                            and understanding of the role myths and art played in Greek religion. The passage 
                            touches on how paintings of mythical and historical topics were displayed in the public 
                            portico, but the image highlights just how important this location was. According to Donald 
                            Robertson, “it’s very public and situated among the shops on the edge of the Athenian agora, 
                            precisely where Socrates used to mingle with craftsmen discussing philosophy.” The display of 
                            myths in such a central location where people would gather and discuss intellectual and cultural 
                            topics shows that religion was fully integrated into everyday life in ancient Greece. 
                            <br>
                            This is important to note when understanding what constitutes Greek religion - it was more than 
                            just personal beliefs and rituals. Having this visual evidence of the Stoa helps us better 
                            understand how central religion was in the civic community. Even though it is just ruins now, 
                            it’s still in the center of the city, hopefully an enduring reminder that Greek myths and religion 
                            weren’t just stories that were told and personal beliefs - they shaped beliefs, identities, and values.

                    <p> “The same absence of finality is characteristic of Greek myth. If there is one reason 
                        beyond all others why we have no tradition of religious myth in our culture, it is 
                        that the Christian ‘myth’ of the Old and New Testament is once for all an unchanging 
                        and unchangeable revelation of divine truth in its entirety; all that is left for 
                        improvisation in the face of new experience is hagiography and martyrology, the 
                        creation of new intermediaries, new saints and new martyrs in the Christian tradition. 
                        By contrast, Greek myth is open-ended; a traditional story can be re-told, told with 
                        new meanings, new incidents, new persons, even with a formal reversal of old meanings,
                         as in the myth of Helen (seduced to Troy as the casus belli of the Trojan war, the 
                         ‘woman of many men’, or in Egypt as a wronged and virtuous wife), or in the myth of 
                         Orestes (example of filial duty to Telemachus in the Odyssey, or paradigm of moral 
                         dilemma, of the inextricability of good and evil in fifth-century tragedy). The 
                         improvisatory character of Greek myth is not just a literary fact, not only the 
                         source of its perennial vitality in literature, but also the guarantee of its 
                         centrality in Greek religion. It is not bound to forms hardened and stiffened by 
                         canonical authority, but mobile, fluent and free to respond to a changing experience 
                         of the world.”


                        <br><br>

                        This passage can help answer what constitutes Greek Religion with its comparison of 
                        the religion to Christianity and its description of the “character” of Greek myth. 
                        Highlighting the differences between Christianity and Greek religion is useful as it 
                        utilizes a widespread religion that most people have a basic understanding of to 
                        describe a key characteristic of Greek religion. It emphasizes the fact that there 
                        isn’t room for changes to Christian stories, even as time passes and the world changes. 
                        By describing Greek myth as “open-ended” and having the ability to be re-told, we 
                        understand how Greek myth helped Greek Religion change with the world.

                        The idea that this passage touches on, that Greek Religion responds to the “changing 
                        experience of the world,” is important as it describes a key characteristic of the 
                        religion. It may be remiss to explain what constitutes Greek Religion without discussing 
                        its changing nature, as it explains why there are various versions of Greek myths 
                        and potentially religious practices. As the author touches on with the examples of 
                        Helen and Orestes’s stories, the myths could change depending on the message that the 
                        people wanted to tell. If people practicing other religions, such as Christianity, 
                        desired to change their stories as such, it would be very discouraged due to the 
                        religion’s pre-existing canons.

                            These two art pieces depict two different versions of Helen’s story, as described 
                            in the passage as “seduced to Troy as the casus belli of the Trojan war, the ‘woman 
                            of many men’, or in Egypt as a wronged and virtuous wife.” The first piece is a 
                            pelike, whose front shows a couple, likely Paris and Helen. Here, Helen seems very 
                            willing to be there, as she is standing in front of him, holding part of her dress. 
                            This aligns with the passage’s description of her as the “woman of many men,” as 
                            she was married to Menelaus but chose to run away with Paris. However, the second 
                            piece is an Etruscan funerary urn depicting the abduction of Helen, representing her 
                            as just another possession forcefully being taken to Paris. This aligns with the other 
                            version of the myth, where Helen is the “wronged and virtuous wife.”

                            This visual representation of the two different pieces demonstrates the stark 
                            differences in versions of the same myth. The version that someone in ancient 
                            Greece would know depended on many factors of their environment - their beliefs, 
                            location, time, etc. This evolving nature in both oral stories and artwork is integral 
                            to ancient Greek religion as it reflects how the religion relied on those participating, 
                            and thus the values and traditions adapted to different communities.
